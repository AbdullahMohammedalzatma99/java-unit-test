1-What is Junit?
JUnit is an open source Unit Testing Framework for JAVA. It is useful for Java Developers to write and run repeatable tests. Erich Gamma and Kent Beck initially develop it. It is an instance of xUnit architecture. As the name implies, it is used for Unit Testing of a small chunk of code.

Developers who are following test-driven methodology must write and execute unit test first before any code.

Once you are done with code, you should execute all tests, and it should pass. Every time any code is added, you need to re-execute all test cases and makes sure nothing is broken.

2-What is Unit Testing?
Unit Testing is used to verify a small chunk of code by creating a path, function or a method. The term “unit” exist earlier than the object-oriented era. It is basically a natural abstraction of an object oriented system i.e. a Java class or object (its instantiated form).

Unit Testing and its importance can be understood by below-mentioned points:

Unit Testing is used to identify defects early in software development cycle.
Unit Testing will compel to read our own code. i.e. a developer starts spending more time in reading than writing.
Defects in the design of code affect the development system. A successful code breeds the confidence of developer.

3. What is the diff between junit and unit test
JUnit framework is a Java framework that is widely used for testing.
It supports the test to run by writing and testing along.
JUnit framework was initially based on the SUnit framework which is used for Unit testing but then later it was updated with Java using Selenium WebDriver. JUnit is now is used as a standard when we need to perform testing in Java.
